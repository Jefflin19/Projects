# 🏋️ **Obesity Prediction Using Machine Learning**  
---

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual is obese based on various health and lifestyle factors. It utilizes a dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** and implements data preprocessing, feature encoding, model training, and a user-friendly GUI for predictions.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook (JupyterLab)**  
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data manipulation)  
- **Scikit-Learn** (for preprocessing and model evaluation)  
- **XGBoost & Random Forest** (for machine learning modeling)  
- **Tkinter** (for building the graphical user interface)  

## 🔄 Project Workflow  

### ✅ 1. Data Preprocessing & Encoding  
The dataset is first cleaned and prepared using three types of encoding techniques to handle categorical variables:  
🔹 **One-Hot Encoding**  
🔹 **Binary Encoding**  
🔹 **Label Encoding**  

### 🧠 2. Machine Learning Pipeline  
The dataset is split into **80% Training, 10% Validation, and 10% Testing** to ensure optimal model performance. The project implements two powerful machine learning algorithms:  
✔️ **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**  
✔️ **Random Forest**  

Each model is trained, validated, and tested to evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and other key performance metrics.  

### 🖥️ 3. GUI Implementation (Tkinter)  
To make the model user-friendly, a **Tkinter-based graphical user interface** (GUI) is developed. Users can enter relevant health and lifestyle variables, and the model will predict whether an individual is obese based on the input values.
