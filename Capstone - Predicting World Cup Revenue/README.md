# **Capstone Project- Predicting the 2026 World Cup impact on tourism**

## **Background**
  From my genuine interest of soccer and tourism, and from going to multiple games in the Euros 2024, I thought about how the 2026 world cup in USA, Mexico and Canada woudl impact tourism revenue. Using historical data from previous World Cups, machine learning can help us take this narrative a step further by predicting the future impact of the tournament on tourism revenue for 2026 in Mexico, Canada, and the US, the hosts of the World Cup.

  It will be the first time in World Cup history that there are three hosts for a single tournament. It will also be interesting to see how the 2030 World Cup plays out, as there are six hosts: three in Europe and three in South America, marking the centennial World Cup competition.


## **Data**
  For this project, data from the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan through to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was required. The data was sourced from various reliable sources, such as Forbes, World Bank, official government reports, Statista, and more. I then organized them into several Excel files, with the main file containing 32 features.
In the end, it is a rather small dataset because the World Cup is hosted every four years, and it is difficult to find data from before 2000.

## **Coding**
  The four languages showcased in this project are HTML, Python, CSS, and JS.
  Three ML models to predict the tourism revenue for 2026.
  Flask is used as the Python web framework to integrate the project into the live server.
  A Tkinter GUI is created to allow users to input feature values.

## **Instructions**
1. Download the entire file
2. Open main.html on live server if using visual studio
3. Can go through each of the different sections, project overview, World Cup locations, 21st Century World Cup Stats, Short-Term Impact, Long-Term Impact
4. Prediction is where ML is used to predict the tourism revenue,
     Must activate the GUI by using python -m appy.py
